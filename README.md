### #RecentProjects  

  * [**Aproximate-String-Matching**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/Approximate-String-Matching): 

The import databases of the General Directorate of Customs have several deficiencies. Among them, foreign suppliers are not modeled as an entity. Therefore, there is no primary key that uniquely identifies foreign suppliers. Through text mining techniques I was able to give structure to unestructured data referring to names of foreign suppliers. This then allowed an important analysis of intra-firm international trade.

  * [**HSCorrelationTables**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/HSCorrelationTables):

The most widespread international product nomenclature in all the customs offices of the world is known as the [**The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System**](http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/overview/what-is-the-harmonized-system.aspx#:~:text=The%20Harmonized%20Commodity%20Description%20and,World%20Customs%20Organization%20(WCO).). The World Custom Organization Committee prepares amendments updating the nomeclature every 5 â€“ 6 years. I desinged a tool to track historical changes introduced to the clasification of any of the 5.000 commodities. This programm allows users to build large time series to analyze long-term economic issues. 

  * [**coswt_scraper**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/coswt_scraper): 

This program parallelizes the download of tax information of any company located in Argentina. The data is hosted in [CuitOnline](https://www.cuitonline.com/) and the programm is based on threadings. 

### #FreeTimeCoding: 

  * [**TA-TE-TI**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/TA-TE-TI-simulation): using Monte-Carlo simulation to find empirical probability. 
  * [**NLP-Disaster**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/NLP-Disasters): a repo based on the Kaggle contest: Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets
  * [**PrimeNumbersNicePlot**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/PrimeNumbersNicePlot): the prime numbers beauty. 
  * [**WineVarietyClassification with R**](https://github.com/Ignacio-Ibarra/WineVarietyClassification): applying Principal Component Analysis and Logistic Regression to the classification of wine varieties based on chemical characteristics.
