## Hi everybody 👋

I'm Nacho, from Buenos Aires.

Data Analytics Engineer at [**Fundar**](https://fund.ar/). Currently working on [**Argendata**](https://argendata.fund.ar/) project.

**Semi-Senior Data Scientist | Economist | Master's Student in Data Mining & KDD**

I hold a degree in Economics from the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery (KDD) at the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the same university. With over 6 years of experience in data science, I've developed expertise in building statistical and machine learning models, applying data mining techniques, and creating ETL processes. My work focuses on public policies related to industrial development and foreign trade, providing insights through advanced reporting and data analysis.

Currently, I'm working at Fundar as a Data Analytics Engineer, where I’m involved in developing Argendata, a data-driven website that leverages multiple sources of information to offer insights on Argentina. My professional interests include machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining, predictive modeling, data ingestion, transformation, and warehousing.
